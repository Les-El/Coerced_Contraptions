\# Introduction



\## Narrative Grounding



It is often said that someone has "a knack" for certain machines. A young child who builds increasingly complex models of steam locomotives since the first time they rode in one. A homeowner who always manages to fix lawn equipment despite never having any training. A coworker who seems to scare your PC into behaving just by walking around your desk. These are examples of people who have the \*\*Coerce Contraptions Ability\*\*.



Coerce Contraptions addresses the relationships between people and the machines they anthropomorphize. People are born, or become, attuned to certain types of Contraptions. Over time, they can become emotionally and even spiritually invested in specific objects. An aura or an imprint of the person and the Contraption can be left on each other, affecting events in physical space.



This sometimes explains the line, "It always works on my computer." Despite everything else being equal, the PC just likes its user more and runs with fewer problems. Or why that one particular pulley has been prone to pinching your hand ever since you had to hammer it back into place.



In a well-known and extreme storyline, Coerce Contraptions explains the feats of the notorious "Rabid Rider." A leather-clad, uneducated, and often feared outcast, he can repair and control certain machines \[with only his hands and the confidence of steel willpower](https://looptube.io/?videoId=VyrDzSdNsUw\&start=9.463235294117647\&end=70.40073529411762\&rate=1).

\## Our Design Methodology



This ability was built on three core design pillars that separate it from standard skill checks:



1\.  \*\*Modifiers Must Be Roleplay-Driven:\*\* The most important factor in a check should not be a static Ability Score. Instead, the \*\*Unified Modifier\*\* system is intentionally designed to quantify the character's \*story\*, \*history\*, and \*current situation\*. A character's pessimism or a recent failure should matter just as much as their training.



2\.  \*\*Risk Must Be A Narrative Choice:\*\* We moved beyond a simple pass/fail mechanic. The \*\*Flavor Spectrum\*\* tells the player the \*severity\* of failure \*before\* they attempt the check. This allows them to make a deliberate, in-character choice: "Is this worth the risk of a Catastrophe?"



3\.  \*\*The GM is the Adjudicator:\*\* This system is a \*framework\*, not a straitjacket. It is designed to give the GM clear, granular tools (the DC, the Unified Modifier, the hidden roll) to arbitrate complex technological challenges and build narrative suspense.

\## Gating and Difficulty



There is a low bar to entry for this Ability (Level 1 and a minor prerequisite). This is intentional. Coerced Contraptions is not about representing a character's "mastery" or genius (which would require a high-level, high-stat prerequisite). Instead, it represents the \*spark\* of a "knack."



The prerequisite is simply the mechanical switch that enables this narrative talent. The \*true\* difficulty comes from the \*\*Unified Modifier\*\*, which is designed to naturally favor negative modifiers. Trying to build something new, repair something you're untrained in, or push the limits of any machine \*should\* be difficult by default. Dangerous, even.



The best way to overcome this tendency towards failure is to invest time, resources, planning, and roleplaying into your Domain.
