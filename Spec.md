# Coerced Contraptions (Custom Ability)

This is a homebrew Ability for interacting with non-magical technology. It can be taken as a Feat, a Class Feature, or as a custom Background option. This system is intended to be a Framework; the GM may adjust any point value, table, or rule to fit the campaign setting.

## Prerequisite and Action Type

* ***Prerequisite:*** Character Level 1st, and a minimum score of 10 in the primary Ability Score relevant to your chosen Domain (e.g., Int for complex electronics, Dex for small mechanisms, Str for heavy industrial equipment). Alternatively, proficiency with an appropriate set of Tools relevant to the Domain may suffice, as determined by the GM.
* ***Action Type:*** This ability is typically an Activity taking minutes or hours, governed by the Time Scope modifier. An in-combat attempt requires your full Action for that turn (see Time Scope below).

---

## I. Special Skill Check

When you use this Ability to attempt to build, fix, or force a Contraption to work, you make a special Coerced Contraptions check.

$$\text{Roll} = \text{d20} + \text{Unified Modifier}$$
**OR**
$$\text{Roll} = \text{d20} + \text{Unified Modifier} + \text{Relevant Ability Modifier}$$

The 'Relevant Ability Modifier' is the same one tied to your Domain and used for this ability's prerequisite (e.g., Intelligence, Dexterity, or Strength).

When you make this check, you roll against a **Difficulty Class (DC)** set by the GM. This DC reflects the **inherent complexity of the task** (e.g., *'how difficult is this specific repair?'*) and the **appropriateness of the tools at hand**, regardless of the surrounding circumstances. All narrative and situational factors (like being rushed, injured, or in a firefight) are handled *exclusively* by the Unified Modifier.

On a success, the Contraption works as intended. On a failure, the outcome is determined by the **Flavor Spectrum** table (Section IV).

The result of this roll is *typically* HIDDEN from all players including yourself. One suggested mechanic is a dedicated die rolled with an upside down cup. The GM may choose to hide this roll to build suspense and reveal the result at a narratively appropriate moment. For simpler or less dramatic tasks, the GM may opt to resolve the check immediately.

***Requirements:*** You must be physically present and within reasonable proximity of the target Contraption. You must be able to employ appropriate physical instruments for the work (e.g., a simple tool, a specialized key, a relevant diagnostic device, a mouse and keyboard). You must dedicate a minimum of one uninterrupted minute to the process, up to even days or months. This minimum time is subject to modification by the Time Scope modifiers (see Unified Modifier).

## II. Defining Your Domain

Your ability only functions on technology within your chosen Domain, which must be clearly defined and approved by the GM (e.g., Pre-War American Radios, Steam Powered Projectile Weapons, Modern Windows Gaming PCs.) You must collaborate with your GM to define your Domain.

* The description must be clear, specific, and attached to your Character Sheet.
* The GM must approve the Domain description.

## III. The Unified Modifier

Calculate your total net Unified Modifier by adding all relevant positives and negatives from the tables below.

* **Unified Modifier Cap:** Total positive modifier may not exceed +5.
* **Impossible Attempt:** A Net Modifier of -6 or lower is considered Impossible.

> **GM Exception (Uncapped Negatives)**
> TGM Exception (Uncapped Negatives) The GM may allow an Impossible Attempt, but the negative modifier is NOT capped. The GM must warn you that failure will be truly catastrophic.

> This exception only applies if success remains mathematically possible. If the target DC for the task is unreachable even on a Natural 20, the attempt is not allowed.

| **Category** | **Modifier** | **Conditions** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Domain (Relevance)** | +1 to +3 | A Perfect Example (rare), Extremely Correlated, or Great Fit to your Domain. |
| | 0 | A Good Example of your Domain. |
| | -1 to -3 | An Average, Poor, or only Technically Qualified example of your Domain. |
| **2. Affinity** | +1 (Stacking) | Built or Completely Rebuilt by You, Almost Daily Use/Interaction, Almost Constantly in Proximity or on Person (not in a Bag of Holding), Substantially Repaired by You, Intimate Knowledge of similar contraption. |
| | -1 (Stacking) | Contraption Nearly Untouched Before, Unfamiliar Design, Unfamiliar or Externally Repaired/Modified, Recently Failed by Only You, Recently Failed by Anyone (including you, stacks,) General Pessimism (Roleplaying). (Clarification: If an ally failed to fix it (-1) and you also failed (-1), you would incur a -2 modifier from the 'Recently Failed by Anyone' clause.) |
| **3. Time of Possession** | +1 to +3 | You have owned and controlled the item for years (5-9-years, 10-19-years, or 20+ year duration). |
| **4. History** | +1 (Stacking) | You have a history of success with this *specific* contraption. |
| | +1 (Stacking) | You have a history of success with a *nearly identical* contraption. |
| | -1 (Stacking) | This contraption has a recent history of failure. (This modifier applies *per failure*, regardless of who was involved. E.g., if you failed to fix it yesterday (-1) and an ally failed this morning (-1), you would incur a -2). |
| | | **Exception:** This penalty does *not* apply to an immediate attempt to fix a brand new problem (such as scrubbing a new virus on your PC, or diagnosing an overheating car that the driver had towed straight to your shop). |
| | -1 (Stacking) | You recently failed with a *similar* contraption. |
| **5. Time Scope** | +1 to +3 | Deliberate, Thorough, or Meticulous (taking extra time to do the task). |
| | -1 to -4 | Quickly, Rushed, Frantic, or Miraculous (using less time). Note: An In-Combat attempt automatically incurs the penalty for Miraculous (-4) in this category. |
| **6. Character Constitution** | -1 to -3 | **Sleep:** Short on sleep (-1), Tired (-2), or Exhausted (-3). |
| | -1 to -3 | **Food:** Hungry (-1), Starving (-2), or Malnourished (-3). |
| | -1 to -3 | **Injury:** Significantly Injured (-1), Majorly Injured (-2), or Grievously Injured (-3). |
| | -1 to -2 | **Comfort:** Majorly Uncomfortable (-1) or Extremely Uncomfortable (-2). |
| | -1 to -2 | **Focus:** Distracted (-1) or Very Distracted (-2). |
| | | *These penalties are cumulative. (e.g., being 'Tired' (-2) and 'Distracted' (-1) results in a -3 modifier).* |

In the interest of streamlined play, you must pre-calclate all expected positive and negative modifiers to key inventory and other Contraptions you expect to Coerce. List each modifier organized line by line for GM’s inspection and approval. Keep this list with your Character Sheet and update as needed. Without this resource, the GM may choose to use a guesstimate for the Unified Modifier

## IV. Failure & The Flavor Spectrum

The severity of failure is determined by your final Unified Modifier.

| **Unified Modifier** | **Flavor Spectrum** | **Failure Result** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| +3 to +5 | Sweet Talking | **Simple Failure:** The Contraption safely fails; it sputters, won't overclock, or stops the repair process. No strong negative consequences. |
| +2 to -2 | Cajoling | **Glitch:** The Contraption fails in an inconvenient or unexpected way (e.g., minor shock damage, loud noise, wrong function, light injury). |
| -3 to -5 | Bullying | **Backlash:** The Contraption actively fights back (e.g., explodes, causes serious injury, severely or permanently breaks, triggers an alarm at enenmy HQ). |
| -6 or Lower | Abuse and Mistreatment | **Catastrophe:** The Contraption fails at the worst possible moment or in the worst possible way (e.g., alerting overwhelming security, destroying a prized Contraption, data is permanently lost, the entire party significantly injured). |
